                <p>This was the very first profile picture I ever used across the internet. It wasn’t the best, but it was simple and affordable. I actually bought it from a schoolmate for £5 when I was in Year 7. Back then, everyone was diving into YouTube and streaming, so it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. However, having my name as my profile picture turned out to be not the greatest idea.</p>

                <h2>The Raid</h2>
                <p>As chaos unfolded in the world, I was deep into one of my many Halo: MCC streams, gaming alongside my best friend. Then, out of nowhere, an unexpected raid swept in and turning a regular session into a milestone that kickstarted my streaming journey.

                    <p>After the raid, my follower count started rising faster than I could have imagined. Every day brought more growth, and then just a few days later it happened. I hit Affiliate! It was a huge milestone, marking the next step in my streaming journey.</p>

                    <h2>Commission</h2>
                    <p>As my channel grew and more followers joined in, I knew it was time for a profile picture upgrade. At the time, I was deep into GTA Online, so I had a clear vision, I just needed the right artist to bring it to life. That’s when I reached out to Remshia for a commission, after being introduced following my affiliate milestone.</p>
